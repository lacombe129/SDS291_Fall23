You are free to use this document to help format your homework assignments, but don't forget to delete this text and change the name/title. If a question has multiple parts, put the main question with a single `#` and the sub-parts (a, b, etc) with 2 hashtags. The more hashtags, the smaller the subheading. To render to a pdf, you will need to go down to the tab labeled "terminal" and type 'quarto install tinytex' to that it can render to a pdf.
