    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nAttendance\nParticipation has two components: 1) being present and 2) engaging in class activities. Your participation is an important part of the process of learning statistics, and we need you in class to help stimulate discussion. You can make a valuable contribution to the discussion by bringing up connections between our work and study designs you have seen in other courses, in the newspaper, or in research literature. I realize that, especially during these difficult times, you won’t always be able to get to class. If you miss class, I ask that you make up for your participation by posting something on slack such as a question about course material, article that relates to course content, or anything else related to course content. I will record lectures and post them on Moodle, but the classroom will not be hybrid. The recording may not pick up everything we cover in class so I encourage you to attend in person. You get one free absence where you do not need to make up for lost participation.\n\n\nCollaboration\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own unless I’m explicitly asking you to submit a group submission. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit. No interaction with anyone but the instructor and course assistant is allowed on any exams. All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code.\n\n\nAcademic Honor Code Statement\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, or other infractions, will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. You must always provide appropriate citations for others’ work and ideas. Giving other scholars due credit in your written and oral communication is a fundamental social gesture in academic work—a way for us to acknowledge each other’s scholarship and signify that we respect each other.\nFrom the Smith honor code website:\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\n\nClassroom Environment\nRealizing the benefits of a diverse space can only occur if we create a climate of psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999). To this end, we will always be respectful of one another. Together we should have the goal of creating an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and opinions. To this end, I value “half-formed,” informal thoughts—sometimes a deeper understanding is reached via communicating ideas before they are perfectly polished. If you have a question, I guarantee there is at least one other student with the same, so please speak up.\n\n\nAccommodations\nEveryone should have all that they need to succeed in this course. Please send me your accommodation letter, or have the Disability Office work with me. If you need to register for accommodations, please contact the Disability Services office at ODS@smith.edu. Please check out the office website for more information. Smith provides flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Smith College Disability Services office, College Hall 104; phone: (413) 585-2071 (voice, TTY, TDD). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation.\nIf you have special needs concerning quiz taking, please bring documentation of your needs and make an appointment to discuss them with me, at least ONE WEEK BEFORE the first exxam. That will give me time to provide accommodation for your needs."

    "text": "Assignments\n\nHomework [20%]: Homework assignments will be given during most weeks of the semester and will be problem sets from the textbook. Assignments will be posted on Thursdays after class and be due by the following Friday by 11:59 PM. Homework should be completed in Quarto; both the .QMD file and resulting html files should be submitted. Homework will be graded. For every day late on the homework assignments I will reduce your grade for that assignment by 10%. I will drop the lowest homework grade at the end of the semester.\nParticipation [10%]: Active participation in class and regular attendance will comprise 10% of your grade. Most class periods will begin with questions from the reading for that day. Participating in the discussion about the readings is a great way to demonstrate engagement. Reading before class will help us move more quickly through content, and focus on the materials you found the most challenging. I will be tracking attendance through a sign up sheet each day, but there is no formal penalty for missed attendance. Attendance will help inform participation grades. As a reminder, participation includes in class work, but also posting on slack, coming to office hours, etc. There are many ways to fully participate in the course.\nExams [30%]: There will be two exams throughout the semester using self-scheduled exams in McConnel Hall. Exams will be mostly short answer, with some asking you to solve a problem set, and others interpreting a regression table, as well as short essay answers explaining concepts. While the second exam is not explicitly cumulative, the content in this course builds on itself.\nIn-Class R Activities [5%]: The R activities are assigned without any prior notice. The goal of these in-class activities is to give timely feedback on your understanding of the current material before the course moves on to new material. These projects are open book and sometimes be assigned as group work. However, each student is expected to write their own code and a report including the reasonable interpretation. Finalized activities are due at 11:59 PM the Sunday after they are assigned.\nCase Studies [15%]: There will be 4 case studies assigned this semester. These activities will give you a chance to individually grapple with a dataset, complete some sort of analysis, and interpret your results. A key component of these case studies is that you are correctly formatting your document with clear variable names, axes labels, hidden code, etc. This is a chance for you to practice creating documents in quarto/markdown. Secondly, I will be evaluating your for accurate and concise interpretation of your analysis.\nFinal Project and Participation [25%]: For your final project you will be conducting a statistical investigation on a topic of your group’s choosing. These projects will be done in groups of 3 (your choice of partner). You will use an existing dataset to answer a research question using statistical analysis (either multiple regression, or logistic regression). This project will include several check ins throughout the semester, and we will have 10-minute visual presentations the last week of class, with the final project being due during finals week. Throughout the semester we will have class time discussing how to choose a research question, finding data, etc. The goal of this project is to give you a firsthand look at how to engage in statistical analysis.\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\nPercent of Total\nDue Date\n\n\n\n\nHomework\n20%\nFridays after assigned\n\n\nIn Class R Activities\n5%\nDaily\n\n\nExams\n30%\nWeekends-Self Scheduled\n\n\nFinal Project\n25%\nSee project guide\n\n\nCase Studies\n15%\nFridays after assigned\n\n\nParticipation\n5%\n\n\n\nFinal Grade\n100%\nFridays after assigned\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrading\nWhen I grade your written work, I am looking for problem solutions that are technically correct and reasoning that is clearly explained. Numerically correct answers, alone, are not sufficient on homework or exams. I value neatness and brief, clear, well-organized answers that explain your thinking. If the grader cannot read or follow your work, they cannot give you credit for it. The grader will check each homework submission for completeness and grade a subset of the exercises. Homework answer keys will be posted on Moodle after the due date.\n\n\nAssignment Late Policy\nFor every day late on the written assignments I will reduce your grade for that assignment by ten percent.

    "section": "Resources",
    "text": "Resources\n\nCourse Website and Moodle\nThe course website will be regularly updated with lecture slides, project information, assignments, and other course resources. Assignments and grades will be submitted via Moodle. You should check both regularly.\n\n\nComputing\nThe use of the R statistical computing environment with the RStudio interface is thoroughly integrated into the course. You have two options for using RStudio:\n\nThe server version of RStudio on the web. The advantage of using the server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud, where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you can access your work from any computer with a web browser (Firefox is recommended) and an Internet connection.\nA desktop version of RStudio installed on your machine. The downside to this approach is that your work is only stored locally, and you will have to manage your own installation. Nevertheless, I still recommend this option because you do not need wifi or network access to work, and you know it is on your computer. I find collaboration easier with this method too.\n\nNote that you do not have to choose one or the other – you may use both. However, it is important that you understand the distinction so that you can keep track of your work. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source, and are installed on most computer labs on campus. Please see the Resources page for help with R.\n\n\nUse of Technology during Class\nAs we will always be using our computers to attend this course, I hope it goes without saying that while the class is in session, you should resist the temptation to use your computer or cell phone for personal email, web browsing, social media, or any activity that’s not related to the class.\n\n\nWriting\nYour ability to communicate results, which may be technical in nature, to your audience, which is likely to be non-technical, is critical to your success as a data analyst. The assignments in this class will place an emphasis on the clarity of your writing. I encourage you to use the Jacobson Center for assistance in writing.\nThe Statistical & Data Sciences Program is committed to ensuring that our students learn the skills necessary to become exemplary writers within our field. To that end, we have adopted a curricular model called Writing Enriched Curriculum, which has enabled us to articulate the writing skills we hope our graduates will acquire. These include:\n\nThe ability to adapt voice and expectations to the requirements of different genres (e.g. blog posts vs. analytical essays)\nThe ability to follow a writing process that includes brainstorming, outlining, initial drafting, peer review, editing, and revising\nThe ability to write with clarity and precision, even about issues of ambiguity and uncertainty\nThe ability to prioritize the important parts of a process and/or project to communicate\nThe ability to communicate a research question and how analysis will support that question\nThe ability to create impactful figures and tables\nThe ability to code with documentation and comments that are correctly indented, use a consistent style, and are human-readable.\n\nMuch of what you do in this course will support your understanding and development of these skills. If you have any questions about them, or would like more help in this work, please contact me and/or make an appointment to take your work to the Jacobson Center for Writing on their website. In particular, you may choose to bring your work to Peer Writing Tutors Elina Gordon-Halpern or Vivian Wei, both SDS majors who tutor for the Jacobson Center. Their schedules are below, but you may contact Sara Eddy (seddy@smith.edu) for more information about their schedules or how to make an appointment.\n\n\nExtra Help\nThere are Statistics TAs available from 7:00-9:00pm on Sunday–Thursday evenings in Sabin-Reed 301 (except on Tuesdays where they are in . In addition, the Spinelli Center for Quantitative Learning (Seeley 207) supports students doing quantitative work across the curriculum. Your fellow students are also an excellent source for explanations, tips, etc.\n\n\nLogistics\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out to me if you are feeling overwhelmed, lost, or need any help. I can connect you to university resources including counseling or other assistance.\nOn a similar note, please reach out before assignments or other deadlines are due if you need extensions, which I am happy to give out. I can accommodate delays if you stay in contact with me. If you have not contacted me all late assignments will have 10% deducted each day, and no assignment will be accepted more than 4 days late.\nI encourage you to post questions and collaborate on slack as a first option before email. I will first defer to students to answer each other’s questions and moderate as I have found explaining concepts can often be even more useful for learning than to hear it explained to you. I encourage you to use Slack to communicate with me as well over email, and my response time will be faster via Slack. Slack is also a great resource for you to work with other students, share notes, and collaborate in general (you can create separate groups for direct messages either with individual students, or with groups).\n\n\nOther Resources\nNote: As an employee of the college I have a mandate to report any incident of sexual or domestic violence that I hear or find out about to the Title IX Coordinator. If you want to make a confidential report, use the EthicsPoint service submission instructions here.\nSmith is committed to providing support services and reasonable accommodations to all students with disabilities. To request an accommodation, please register with the Disability Services Office at the beginning of the semester. See this link for instructions and please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions, concerns, or suggestions for how I can facilitate your learning in this course.\n\n\nCode of Conduct\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nEveryone is expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: lectures, office hours, tutoring hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is available here.\n\n\nTentative Schedule\nPlease refer to the complete day-to-day schedule for more detailed information."

    "text": "The learning goals of this first mini project are\nYou will conduct an online experimental study using survey methodology. Your experiments will be set up using the Qualtrics survey platform. Your experiments will utilize vingettes or very simple visual stimuli presentation.\nYour study is required to be experimental, meaning you will manipulate a factor and randomly assign levels of that factor to units (people). For this first mini project you must employ a randomized one-way design. Your factor must have at least three levels. You will be creating at least three carefully controlled conditions (i.e., three vignettes). These three (or more) conditions will be randomly assigned to people (fellow classmates). They are your “experimental units”.\nThis mini project will require you to design a one-way study, implement that study in Qualtrics, collect and analyze relevant data, and hand in a short written report describing your study and its findings. Your project will involve fitting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model and checking the ANOVA conditions. ANOVA is the primary statistical technique we are learning in this course. The project is an opportunity to apply and synthesize the material we are learning in class to a specific context. It will also give you the opportunity to show off what you have learned about data analysis, visualization, and variance decomposition in this course and from other SDS courses you may have taken. These projects are a major component of the class, and successful completion is required to pass."

    "text": "The learning goals of this second mini project are\n\nto design an experiment where you have flexibility in your design choices,\nto gain experience discussing design choices, and\nto gain experience distributing research work within a collaborative team, and\nto gain experience presenting your research work in an oral presentation format.\n\nYou will again conduct an online experimental study using survey methodology in groups of about 3. Your experiments will be set up using the Qualtrics survey platform. Your experiments will again utilize vingettes or very simple visual/audio stimuli presentation. In addition to submitting a technical report for MP2, your group will present a 6-to-8 minute presentation of your study, complete with slides the last week of the semester.\nYour study is required to have at least one experimental factor, meaning you will manipulate this factor and randomly assign levels of those factors to units. For this second mini project you may pick any design your group likes, but you must have at least two factors of interest. These factors can be a mixture of experimental and observational factors. Your factors may each have more than two levels (but please do not go crazy — a more complex design means you will need a larger sample size!). You may also decide to have blocking in this study. If you decide to have blocks, by far the simplest way to do this with human subjects is by reusing materials, that is, the participants are your blocks and the units are time slots. You might then decide to have one between-subjects factor and one within-subjects factor (creating a split-plot/repeated measures design). Creating blocks with human subjects by grouping people based on some pre-survey responses is just not feasible in the MP2 time frame, I hope you see why…\nThis mini project will require you to design a new study, implement that study in Qualtrics, collect and analyze relevant data, and hand in a short written report describing your study and its findings. You will also be presenting your work the final week of classes. You will complete all of this work in groups of about 3 students. Your project will again involve fitting an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model. The project is an opportunity to apply and synthesize the material we are learning in class to a specific context. It will also give you the opportunity to show off what you have learned about data analysis, visualization, and variance decomposition in this course and from other SDS courses you may have taken. These projects are a major component of the class, and successful completion is required to pass.\n\nResearch Questions\nAfter settling on a research question within your groups, you will begin creating your experimental stimuli and surveys in Qualtrics.\nPicking a good research question might be tricky. But start by brain storming things about people that you are interested in. You might start in your groups by going around an describing your MP1’s to each other. Same examples as for MP1 here: Perhaps you are interested in how stressful people perceive different situations to be, or their helping behavior given different characteristics of a person in need. You might also assess health behaviors — for example, making judgement about which exercises to do, or foods to eat, or which situations might lead people to be more or less likely to want to get vaccinated. Starting with something your are curious about with regards to your own behavior is often and interesting place to start. When choosing your research question the most important feature is that you would be able to write short (two or three sentences) vignettes, varying the scenarios, characteristics, features, etc., to answer your question. Although again I will not be grading specifically on creativity for this assignment, because you are working in groups of three, I expect that you’ll be able to settle on a research question/topic that is relatively interesting. You are welcome to expand on a topic that one of you did for MP1, in fact, I encourage this. A good research program often involves a set of experiments and studies that build on one another. Just make it something very doable that can capture your interest for the last few weeks of this course!\n\n\nHypotheses\nThe topics I list above are meant to get you started, you should pose the question you want to answer as precisely as possible at the outset. Next, identify the factor(s) of interest, the levels of these factors (i.e., treatment conditions), and think about how you will measure your response variable. You should also make hypotheses, a priori (before you collect and analyze the data), about the results you expect to see. Remember that each design comes with a set of questions that it can answer.\nYour hypotheses should include the direction of the effects you expect. For example, if one of your factors is nutrition and the levels are unhealthy and healthy presented across different vingettes, then you might hypothesize that people will rate the healthy condition as more nutritious than the unhealthy condition.\n\n\nGeneral Rules\nYou may discuss your project with students outside of your groups, but each group will have a different topic, so there is a limit to how much you can help each other. You may consult other sources for information about the non-statistical, substantive issues in your problem, but you should credit these sources in your report. Feel free to consult Randi or the Stats TAs about statistical questions.\n\n\nSubmission\nAll deliverables must be delivered electronically via Moodle by the due date. Please submit\n\nRendered file (with code hidden)\nthe cleaned data generated by your experiment,\nthe .Rmd/.QMD file you use to analyze your data, and generate your report.\n\nOnly one person from your group needs to submit. I will know who’s in which group and will record your grades accordingly.\n\n\nOral Presentation\n\nContent\nYou should not need to present all of the R code that you wrote throughout the process of working on this project. Rather, the oral presentation should contain the minimal set of R code that is necessary to understand your results and findings in full. If you make a claim, it must be justified by explicit calculation. A knowledgeable reviewer should be able to compile your accompanying .Rmd file without modification, and verify every statement that you have made. All of the R code necessary to produce your figures and tables must appear in the accompanying .Rmd/.QMD file. In short, the oral presentation and accompanying .Rmd/.QMD file should enable a reviewer to reproduce your work in full.\n\n\nTone\nThis presentation will be given to the class during the final week of the semester. You should aim for a level of complexity that is more statistically sophisticated than an article in the Science section of The New York Times, but less sophisticated than an academic journal. For example, you may use terms that that you will likely never see in the Times (e.g. bootstrap), but should not dwell on technical points with no obvious ramifications for the listener (e.g. reporting why the F-distribution is used for ratios of chi-square distributed random variables). Your goal for this paper is to convince a statistically-minded listener (e.g. a student in this class, a student from another school who has taken an introductory statistics class that you have addressed your research question in a meaningful way. Even a listener with no background in statistics should be able to watch your presentation and get the gist of it.\n\n\nFormat\nYour oral presentation should follow this basic format:\n\nIntroduction: an overview of your project. In a few sentences, you should explain clearly and precisely what your research question(s) are and what hypotheses you have about them.\nMethod: a detailed description of your study design. Describe the factors, each level, if there is crossing, blocks, etc. Here is where you also describe your materials/stimuli. What were your experimental units? How did you measure your responses variable? How did you deliver your manipulation? The method section of a research study is extremely important for others to assess the validity of your findings and to replicate what you found in future studies.\nResults: an explanation of what your model tells us about the research question. You will be using ANOVA here, but also present visualizations such as a scatter plot, box plot, confidence intervals, etc. You should interpret effect sizes and CIs in context and explain their relevance. What does your model tell us that we didn’t already know before? You also want to include null results, but be careful about how you interpret them. For example, you may want to say something along the lines of: “we found no evidence that factor \\(A\\) has an effect on response variable \\(y\\).” On other hand, you probably shouldn’t claim: “there is no effect of factor \\(A\\) on \\(y\\).”\nConclusion: a quick summary of your findings and a discussion of their limitations. First, remind the reader of the question that you originally set out to answer, and summarize your findings. Second, discuss the limitations of your model, and what could be done to improve it. You might also want to do the same for your data. This is your last opportunity to clarify the scope of your findings before a journalist misinterprets them and makes wild extrapolations! Protect yourself by being clear about what is not implied by your research. Lastly, include thoughts about future directions for you next research project in this line of inquiry.\n\n\n\nAdditional Thoughts\nThe oral presentation is not simply a dump of all the R code you wrote during this project. Rather, it is a narrative, with technical details, that describes how you addressed your research question. You should not present tables or figures without giving an explanation of the information that is supposed to be conveyed by that table or figure. Keep in mind the distinction between data and information. Data is just numbers, whereas information is the result of analyzing that data and digesting it into meaningful ideas that human beings can understand. Your presentation should allow a reviewer to follow your steps from converting data into information. The presentation should be about 6-8 minutes. You will not receive extra credit for simply describing your data ad infinitum. For example, simply displaying a table with the means and standard deviations of your variables is not meaningful. Writing a sentence that reiterates the content of the table (e.g. “the mean of variable \\(x\\) was 34.5 and the standard deviation was 2.8…”) is equally meaningless. **What you should strive to do is interpret these values in context (e.g. “although variables** \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) have similar means, the spread of \\(x_1\\) is much larger, suggesting…”).\nIf you do choose to include figures and/or tables, and I think you should, you should present figures and tables in your presentation in context. These items should be understandable on their own, in the sense that they have understandable titles, axis labels, legends, and captions. Someone glancing through your presentation should be able to make sense of your figures and tables without having to read the entire report. That said, you should also include a discussion of what you want the reader to learn from your figures and tables."

Your participation is an important part of the process of learning statistics, and we need you in class to help stimulate discussion. You can make a valuable contribution to the discussion by bringing up connections between our work and study designs you have seen in other courses, in the newspaper, or in research literature. If you miss class, I ask that you make up for your participation by posting something on slack such as a question about course material, article that relates to course content, or anything else related to course content. I will upload lecture slides on the course website, and I encourage you to get notes from another student and come to office hours with questions. You get one free absence that won’t affect your participation grade (no questions asked and no need to contact me).\n\n\nCollaboration\nMuch of this course will operate on a collaborative basis, and you are expected and encouraged to work together with a partner or in small groups to study, complete homework assignments, and prepare for exams. However, every word that you write must be your own unless I’m explicitly asking you to submit a group submission. Copying and pasting sentences, paragraphs, or blocks of code from another student is not acceptable and will receive no credit. No interaction with anyone but the instructor and course assistant is allowed on any exams. All students, staff and faculty are bound by the Smith College Honor Code.\n\n\nAcademic Honor Code Statement\nCases of dishonesty, plagiarism, or other infractions, will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. You must always provide appropriate citations for others’ work and ideas. Giving other scholars due credit in your written and oral communication is a fundamental social gesture in academic work—a way for us to acknowledge each other’s scholarship and signify that we respect each other.\nFrom the Smith honor code website:\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Cases of dishonesty, plagiarism, etc., will be reported to the Academic Honor Board.\n\n\n\nClassroom Environment\nRealizing the benefits of a diverse space can only occur if we create a climate of psychological safety (Edmondson, 1999). To this end, we will always be respectful of one another. Together we should have the goal of creating an environment where we all feel comfortable sharing our thoughts and opinions. To this end, I value “half-formed,” informal thoughts—sometimes a deeper understanding is reached via communicating ideas before they are perfectly polished. If you have a question, I guarantee there is at least one other student with the same, so please speak up.\n\n\nAccommodations\nEveryone should have all that they need to succeed in this course. Please send me your accommodation letter, or have the Disability Office work with me. If you need to register for accommodations, please contact the Disability Services office at ODS@smith.edu. Please check out the office website for more information. Smith provides flexible and individualized accommodation to students with documented disabilities that may affect their ability to fully participate in course activities or to meet course requirements. To receive accommodation services, students must be registered with the Smith College Disability Services office, College Hall 104; phone: (413) 585-2071 (voice, TTY, TDD). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the instructor for a confidential discussion of their individual needs for academic accommodation.\nIf you have special needs concerning quiz taking, please bring documentation of your needs and make an appointment to discuss them with me, at least ONE WEEK BEFORE the first exxam. That will give me time to provide accommodation for your needs."

    "text": "For this lab you will be estimating a simple regression to model the relationship between the size of a house (in 1,000s of square feet) and the price (in $1,000’s) for houses in Canton NY. The dataset is built into the ‘Stat2Data’ package, so make sure you load it into a chunk in R. As always, you first need to load packages. Load tidyverse, Stat2Data, and ggplot2. The lab must be written in Quarto/Rmarkdown and turned in as a .QMD and .HTML (or pdf) file. This is designed to be finished during class time, but you have until Sunday, September 17th (11:59 PM).\nI’ve included some sample code but removed some variable/object names to force you to customize it to work. Make sure you turn in your own, unique lab assignment, but you are encouraged to collaborate in groups to work on the lab. Remember all code should be in chunks, sections labeled with headings, and text written in white space.\n\n\n\nlibrary(Stat2Data)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\n\n\n\ndata(HousesNY)\n### IF you want to learn more about the dataset\n?HousesNY\n\n\n\n\nBefore you ever begin analyzing data, you need to check the data to make sure it measures what you think you think it is, and check for outliers, potential errors, or other properties of each variable. The most basic form of that is to estimate basic descriptive statistics. The below code takes the descriptive statistics for the Price variable from our HouseNY dataframe and constructs a table with the mean, sd, min, max, and number of observations.\n\nHousesNY |&gt;\n  summarise(mean_price=mean(Price), sd_price=sd(Price), min_price=min(Price), max_price=max(Price), sample_size=n())\n\n  mean_price sd_price min_price max_price sample_size\n1   113.6321 41.43006      38.5     197.5          53\n\n\n\n\nIn particular, note if the values make sense (are there any negative ones, really high/low values, etc). 2-3 sentences should suffice.\n\n\n\n\nWhile descriptive statistics are useful, it’s also incredibly helpful to plot the data to get a better idea for the distribution of observations. Histograms can help us see if there are outlier, and get an understanding if the variable is actually continuous or not. The sample code below makes a histogram for the price variable.\n\nggplot(HousesNY, aes(x=Price))+ geom_histogram()\n\n`stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to include a sentence or two noting if the variable appears continuous, if there are any outliers, and any other notable observations on the measure.\n\n\n\n\nWe can use a scatter plot to check to see if the relationship is linear or not. The sample code below makes a scatter plot between the a property’s lot size (in acres) and price. geom_point tells R that the ggplot should be a scatter plot. It looks like there is no clear pattern or relationship in the data.\n\nggplot(HousesNY, aes(x=Lot, y=Price))+ geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nWe can add a line of best fit by adding the command geom_smooth to our gpplot (see below). We add the instructions method=\"lm\" to tell R to force the function to be linear (a straight line). Notice the line is essentially flat, which would indicate no relationship.\n\nggplot(HousesNY, aes(x=Lot, y=Price))+ geom_point() + geom_smooth(method=\"lm\")\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMake a scatter plot between size and price. Include a line of best fit (make it linear). Include a brief description of what you observe. Is the slope negative/positive? Does it look roughly linear? etc.\n\n\n\n\nWe will get to the other conditions later, but for now we decide to estimate a linear model. The sample code below tells are to estimate a linear model (lm) with the dependent variable being Price, and independent variable Lot. We need to tell R to use our dataframe, and save the results into an object. When we summarize that object, we can see the regression table.\n\nmodel1 &lt;- lm(Price~Lot, data=HousesNY)\nsummary(model1)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = Price ~ Lot, data = HousesNY)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-74.775 -30.201  -5.941  27.070  83.984 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

Note whether the relationship is positive or negative, and if the relationship is statistically signficant. Include a sentence interpeting the intercept, and one interpreting the coefficient for “size.” What can we conclude about the influence of house size on price?\nNote, pay careful attention to your units!"
